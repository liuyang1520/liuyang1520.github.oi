Welcome to <a href="http://liuyang1520.github.io/">Arkdemic</a>!

I am Marvin, the helmsman of this Ark. I got my undergraduate degree in Huazhong University of Science & Technology, and did my graduate study in University of Calgary. Now I am a software developer in Calgary. Please check my <a href="/resume/">RESUME</a> and <a href="/skills/">SKILLS</a> for details.

I love minimalist designs, elegant code, and geek techs. This Ark is intended for sharing tech trouble I encountered, solutions I learned, and interesting things I experienced. Please visit <a href="/blog/">BLOG</a> for more contents.

If communication is needed, please feel free to leave me messages on the listed online social website, or directly send email to liuyang1520[a]gmail[d]com.
